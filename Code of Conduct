Code of Conduct: 

The coursework mustn’t be the result of one individual’s work, but a group effort. This makes it so that this is an assessment of group effort rather than individual productivity; the ability to work together is vital in current and future tech industries. However, individual contributions will be assessed/quantified to weed out/attend to those who are lacking in productivity. Each individual should be allotted a task or two of their own so there isn’t any overlap in work produced and so each member has a relatively simple goal in mind, which aids in the reduction of complexity.

If an individual does fail to be productive/achieve their individual goal in this assignment or fail to abide by the guidelines that the team has set out for them, then they are to be trialed (evidence would be needed). The accused will be able to claim mitigating circumstances for themselves. It is up to the module delivery team to decide whether the accused are removed from the group or not. This can be appealed for a week after that.

When the coursework is finished, it should be submit on Github by one of the team members (presumably the Team Leader).

As for the code review meetings, during lab sessions, there will be four meetings and each of them will be graded. We will be given attendance times during these meetings. The code review will last at a maximum of 10 minutes.

Guidelines for the meeting:

Not attending a meeting makes it 0 of course. 

If you show up late to a meeting then your score will be capped at 40. This applies to even being just not ready.

You must be logged in and fully ready to initiate the meeting as soon as the allotted time of the meeting starts.

if you missed the first meeting you will buy a coofe to the rest of thr team, if you miss the second one will be a lunch,and if you missed the thread meeting in a row you will be considered to be out from the group
