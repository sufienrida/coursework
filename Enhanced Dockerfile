This version of the Dockerfile includes the following changes:

Added --chown option to the copy command to ensure that the files are owned by the app user.
Installed gunicorn as a production-ready WSGI HTTP server.
Added apk commands to install necessary development libraries for compiling cryptography library.
Installed cryptography library for secure connections.
Added a healthcheck command to ensure that the application is healthy and responsive.
Changed the CMD to start gunicorn instead of python.
Added User directive to run the command as the app user for security reasons.
Note: The app:app argument in the gunicorn command assumes that the Flask application object is named app. You should replace it with the appropriate name if you're using a different name for your Flask application object.
